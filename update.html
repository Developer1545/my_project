                <h4> Computer (noun): a device, usually electronic, used for storing and processing data in binary form

                <h3>Why are Computers so important in today's society? </h3>

                <h4> Communication </h4>
                <h4> Education </h4>
                <h4> The Economy</h4>
                <br>
                <h3>

                    Many people daily depend on computers to communicate with friends and family.
                    Students depend on computers for their school work. The economy also depends on computers, for
                    example,
                    the stock market and online shopping. Many stock trades are made through online banking which
                    requires computers to handle them. Many online shopping stores depend on computers to make sales and
                    deliveries to the right locations.
                    All of these wouldn't have been possible without certain advancements in certain areas of digital
                    computing.
                    For example, the invention of the internet was huge as internet users went from research to 3.2
                    Billion users in under 60 years!

                Above is the ENIAC, or the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer. This computer was composed of
                18,000 vacuum tubes and weighed 30 tons! It took up a whole room and had many manual switches. It was
                built at the University of Pennsylvania by John Mauchly and J. Presper Ecker. It was built for the
                United States Miltary to perform calculations for WW2. It could add as many as 5,000 digits in a second.
                One main difference from a computer today is that it had no memory to store certain functions and
                commands.
