        <h1>Computer Science Basics</h1>
        <h4> Computer (noun): a device, usually electronic, used for storing and processing data in binary form following the instructions of a program </h4>
        <hr>
        <h3>Why are Computers so important in today's society? </h3>

        <h4> Communication </h4>
        <h4> Education </h4>
        <h4> The Economy</h4>
        <br>
        <h3>

        Many people daily depend on computers to communicate with friends and family.
       Students depend on computers for their school work. The economy also depends on computers, for example,
       the stock market and online shopping. Many stock trades are made through online banking which requires computers to handle them. Many online shopping stores depend on computers to make sales and deliveries to the right locations.
       All of these wouldn't have been possible without certain advancements in certain areas of digital computing.
       For example, the invention of the internet was huge as internet users went from research to 3.2 Billion users in under 60 years!

            Above is the ENIAC, or the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer. This computer was composed of 18,000 vacuum tubes and weighed 30 tons! It took up a whole room and had many manual switches. It was built at the University of Pennsylvania by John Mauchly and J. Presper Ecker. It was built for the United States Miltary to perform calculations for WW2. It could add as many as 5,000 digits in a second. One main difference from a computer today is that it had no memory to store certain functions and commands.

            <h1> The Transistor</h1>
            <p>
               Vacuum Tubes were great and all... but they were big and bulky, which was one of the reasons a computer weight nearly 30 tons! Luckily that was solved with the invention of the transistor. In the core of all processors, there are very small transistors made of silicon. Transistors can furthermore be used to make logic gates which are better explained under the Binary tab. Transistors inside of a computer are made of Silicon, which is a semiconductor. This means that it can control electrical current flow. Computers can perform millions of tasks in seconds thanks to these transistors.

            <p>
                The Internet is probably one of the most important things in our lives today. Originally the internet was a Department of Defense project. They wanted ways of transferring data without using telephone lines as they were prone to damage. In February of 1958, Neil McElroy of the Department of Defense signed the Dept. of Defense Directive 5105.15 which launched the Advanced Research Project Agency(ARPA). This was the start of the internet. ARPANET was the first working internet model that sent its first message on 8/29/1969. One computer was located at UCLA and the other at Stanford University. 2014 marketed 45 years since ARPANET was invented.            </p>

            <p>
                Modern computing relies solely on Binary Digits 1 and 0. Binary Digits represent a form of math called Boolean Logic which means there are two possible conditions, TRUE or FALSE. These are furthermore represented by HIGH or LOW voltages. Boolean Logic is also very reliable when it comes to storing data. There are many different sets of encoding rules when Binary Digits are used. Binary digits can represent a lot. When you want to represent text you use ASCII. Every pixel in an image is represented by 3 binary sequences that correspond to a primary color. Numbers are used to determine the intensity of the color, then the numbers are transmitted to the liquid crystals. If multiple colors reoccur in a row, the data may be compressed to save space. Sound waves are stored via Pulse-Code Modulation. The Computers records the Amplitude of the sound wave every few seconds and stores the values as binary digits. There could be as many as 44,000 binary digits in one second of sound. When played back, the digits tell the speakers how the coils should vibrate to produce sound.

                        Many may get confused when it comes to memory and storage. Many would say they are the same, but there are differences. Inside of a computer, memory is typically static or temporary, meaning if a computer loses power, then the data in the memory gets lost. Below is a unit of memory chart. You can figure out how many bits are in a Megabyte, or how many Megabytes are in a Gigabyte. This specific chart allows you to go up to a Petabyte of storage. Many personal computers have an average of 1 Terabyte of storage, so a Petabyte would be 1000 Terabytes. Unless you are a photographer, make videos, or do anything that requires a large amount of space, 1 Terabyte is usually enough for the average person.

            <h1 style="color:0f223f">Common Programming Languages</h1>
            <p>
               Programming Languages are sets of instructions computers follow to perform tasks. For example, the browser running this
               program is following instructions to display this infographic correctly. When you click on an image in this infographic
               The computer follows more instructions to open up the page for more information. There are many types of programming languages such as object-oriented, Functional programming, procedural, etc. Object-Oriented means that the data within the program stored through objects. This also allows the specific data to be used more than once throughout the code. Procedural Programming means that the language uses things such as loops and many variables that eventually lead to a result.
               A basic way to tell languages apart is to see if they are compiled or not. Another way professionals tell languages apart is by the way you write the code. When code is written in a way that tells a computer how to complete a task, it is an imperative language. When code is written by the programmer that tells the computer exactly what to do, the language type is
                declarative.

				<p>
                    An interpreted language is a programming language that doesn't need to be compiled. To compile in programming means
                    to turn into machine or assembly code. This code can be read directly by the processor.

                 <p style="height:15vh; width:20vw; word-wrap:break-word; margin-bottom:10%;">Above is the Javascript programming language, used in many websites. Javascript is an object-oriented scripting language, which means that data and functions is stored in the form of objects.
               Javascript is a scripting object-oriented language because it carries traits of a full object-oriented language,
               but it doesn't carry specific traits to make it a full programming language.
               With Javascript, you can also get libraries for Javascript that allow it to run outside of a browser.
               One popular library in Node.js. With Node, you can program many things such as whole webservers.

                <p>
                    A compiled language is a programming language that has to be compiled into machine or assembly language. These languages
                   usually are harder to learn because their concept is harder.

                <p style="height:15vh; width:35vw; word-wrap:break-word; margin-top:10%;">You may be thinking, Java and Javascript? sounds like the same thing, but they are very different. Javascript helps add functionality to websites and it is only mainly run in a browser. Java can be also used on the web, but serverside, meaning it deals with the server portion of a website. Java can do a lot. You can program apps for android and desktops. The other main difference is that Java has to be compiled and Javascript doesn't. They are even different when it comes to the type of language they are. Java is object-oriented and Javascript is a scripting object-oriented language.

            <h1>The GUI (Graphic User Interface) and The Internet</h1>
            <p>
                The Graphic User Interface was a huge advancement in computing. Instead of writing instructions in a console to your computer,
                you could now click on icons to open certain programs. In the 1970's Xerox Labs began building a systems like the GUI, which later
                turned into the GUI. Before the GUI, you would have to type commands into a console and then the computer would follow the instructions.
                For example if you wanted to save to a text file you may have to use the command 'open [filename].txt, then edit it in the console.
                With the GUI, you could just click the file and edit it in a program, such as notepad. Parts of the GUI that are common are buttons,
                cursors, and icons you can click on.

                        Input/Output device hasn't always existed with computers. Douglas Engelbart invented this device in 1964. It was orginally made out of wood, a circut board,
                        and a wheel that when it was placed on a desk would control the device. In 1972,  Bill English invented innovated the mouse with
                        a ball. English worked at Xerox, which was one of the first to use the GUI in a computer. The mouse made it easier for the user
                        to control what happened on the computer. In 1988 Lisa M. Williams and Robert S. Cherry invented the optical mouse.
